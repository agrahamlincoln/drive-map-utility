Drive Mapping Utility for Windows, supports loading json files with known file-shares and lists of file-shares for each user.

This is a GUI application for mapping fileshares by loading a json file with known fileshares. The utility will map multiple drives in Windows as specified.

As shares are encountered, the drive mappings are saved to both a JSON file with the unique fileshares listed and a JSON file with the fileshare mappings listed.
